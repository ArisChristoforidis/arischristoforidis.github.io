## About

Synoche is a word-association puzzle game developed for the __World’s Largest Hackathon presented by Bolt__, which focused on building applications using Bolt's agentic LLM. The gameplay centers on completing word chains by guessing intermediate terms that form compound or commonly associated phrases like the following:

__🔥 FIRE -> 🚚 TRUCK -> 🛏️ BED -> 🐞 BUG__

__(firetruck) -> (truck bed) -> (bed bug)__

I used Devvit with React Webviews inside Bolt, guiding the LLM to write and refine features through iterative prompts. While debugging occasionally required detailed descriptions or code examples, the overall development was fast and efficient. The result is a clean, responsive app that includes both gameplay and a custom puzzle editor for user-generated content.
