## 👋 Hey, I'm Aris

I am a Software Engineer based in Thessaloniki, Greece.
I got my BS in __Applied Informatics__ and MS in __Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics__ from the University of Macedonia.

My professional interests lie primarily in Machine Learning, with a specific focus on ML optimization. However, I enjoy working on a broad range of projects related to ML and data science. In my spare time, I also enjoy building full-stack apps and making (small) games.
 
Some of my projects:

- [✨ Sharp Star](https://github.com/ArisChristoforidis/sharp-star) 
- [🕹️ Emoji Quiz](https://www.emojiquiz.net/)
- [🌐 Reddit Recommender](https://arischristoforidis.github.io/reddit-recommender/)

I also like to participate in hackathons from time to time. Here are some things I made in the past:

- [🔗 Synoche](/programming/synoche)
- [⛳ Puttit](https://devpost.com/software/puttit)
- [🗺️ Point of Reference Navigation](https://devpost.com/software/point-of-reference-navigation)
