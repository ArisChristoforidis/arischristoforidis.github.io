Welcome to my collection of interests. I dabble in a few areas — here’s a bit about them.

## Photography

I got into photography through travel. I mostly shoot film on a Nikon FM2 and a Ricoh GRIII.

## Watchmaking

Taking apart watches is a relaxing sort of chaos. I fix, restore, and sometimes ruin old pieces.
